# This is a file that is generated by our core build system.  It contains
# CMake logic that includes the export files for each of the
# exported targets that are generated by the PLplot core build.
# The includes are optional to allow software packagers to divide up
# the PLplot exported targets into individual packages with complete
# freedom so long as their packages have the appropriate dependencies
# between them.
